For our final year at NJIT we chose to attempt to create a form of smart glasses using a Rasperry Pi Zero W 
This repository is a place to see our code progression and 3D modeling progression.

Our goal by the end of this year is to create a working protoype.

Some main features of the smart glasses are:
    Photo @ 1920x1080
    Video @ 1280x720 
    Beam saved photo and video through bluetooth to external device
    
  Possible features are:
    Language translation
    Toggable flashlight
    Voice Command
